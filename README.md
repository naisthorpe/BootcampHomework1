# BootcampHomework1

## What

----------

For this assignment I refactored an existing HTML file and CSS file with an emphasis on accessibility, readability, and consolidation, and without altering the display of the web page.

## Why

----------

I did this refactoring as my first homework assignment for UNC Charlotte's coding bootcamp. 

## How

----------

First I added alt tags to all images for accessiblity purposes, updated the site's title in the &lt;head&gt;, and added a type to the CSS link. Next I replaced HTML &lt;div&gt; tags with relevant HTML semantic tags to improve the readability of the code. As I did this, I updated the CSS tags to match the HTML revisions I had done. After finishing those revisions, I looked for redundancies within the CSS file and consolidated as many tags as I could. I also removed the empty HTML &lt;div&gt; tag that was being used for the background image, and adjusted the CSS file so the background image was presented before the &lt;main&gt; container.
